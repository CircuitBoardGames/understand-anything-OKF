# /understand-dashboard

Start the Understand Anything dashboard to visualize the knowledge graph for the current project.

## Instructions

1. Determine the project directory and data directory:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a path, use that as the project directory
   - Otherwise, use the current working directory
   - Prefer the legacy `.understand-anything/` data directory when it exists, otherwise use `.ua/`

   Use the Bash tool to resolve:
   ```bash
   PROJECT_ARG="$ARGUMENTS"
   if [ -n "$PROJECT_ARG" ]; then
     PROJECT_DIR=$(cd "$PROJECT_ARG" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
   else
     PROJECT_DIR=$(pwd -P)
   fi

   if [ -z "$PROJECT_DIR" ] || [ ! -d "$PROJECT_DIR" ]; then
     echo "Error: Project directory not found: ${PROJECT_ARG:-$PWD}"
     exit 1
   fi

   if [ -d "$PROJECT_DIR/.understand-anything" ]; then
     UA_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR/.understand-anything"
   else
     UA_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR/.ua"
   fi
   ```

2. Check that `$UA_DIR/knowledge-graph.json` exists in the project directory. If not, tell the user:
   ```
   No knowledge graph found. Run /understand first to analyze this project.
   ```

   Use the Bash tool to check:
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f "$UA_DIR/knowledge-graph.json" ]; then
     echo "No knowledge graph found. Run /understand first to analyze this project."
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. Find the dashboard code. The dashboard is at `packages/dashboard/` relative to this plugin's root directory. Check these paths in order and use the first that exists:
   - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/packages/dashboard/` (Claude Code runtime root, highest priority)
   - `~/.understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/` (universal symlink, all installs)
   - Two levels up from `~/.agents/skills/understand-dashboard` real path (self-relative fallback)
   - Two levels up from `~/.copilot/skills/understand-dashboard` real path (Copilot personal skills fallback)
   - Common clone-based install roots:
     - `~/.codex/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/`
     - `~/.opencode/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/`
     - `~/.pi/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/`
     - `~/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/`

   Use the Bash tool to resolve:
   ```bash
   SKILL_REAL=$(realpath ~/.agents/skills/understand-dashboard 2>/dev/null || readlink -f ~/.agents/skills/understand-dashboard 2>/dev/null || echo "")
   SELF_RELATIVE=$([ -n "$SKILL_REAL" ] && cd "$SKILL_REAL/../.." 2>/dev/null && pwd || echo "")
   COPILOT_SKILL_REAL=$(realpath ~/.copilot/skills/understand-dashboard 2>/dev/null || readlink -f ~/.copilot/skills/understand-dashboard 2>/dev/null || echo "")
   COPILOT_SELF_RELATIVE=$([ -n "$COPILOT_SKILL_REAL" ] && cd "$COPILOT_SKILL_REAL/../.." 2>/dev/null && pwd || echo "")

   PLUGIN_ROOT=""
   for candidate in \
     "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" \
     "$HOME/.understand-anything-plugin" \
     "$SELF_RELATIVE" \
     "$COPILOT_SELF_RELATIVE" \
     "$HOME/.codex/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin" \
     "$HOME/.opencode/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin" \
     "$HOME/.pi/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin" \
     "$HOME/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"; do
     if [ -n "$candidate" ] && [ -d "$candidate/packages/dashboard" ]; then
       PLUGIN_ROOT="$candidate"; break
     fi
   done

   if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
     echo "Error: Cannot find the understand-anything plugin root."
     echo "Checked:"
     echo "  - ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-<unset CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT>}"
     echo "  - $HOME/.understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "  - ${SELF_RELATIVE:-<unresolved path derived from ~/.agents/skills/understand-dashboard>}"
     echo "  - ${COPILOT_SELF_RELATIVE:-<unresolved path derived from ~/.copilot/skills/understand-dashboard>}"
     echo "  - $HOME/.codex/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "  - $HOME/.opencode/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "  - $HOME/.pi/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "  - $HOME/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "Make sure you followed the installation instructions for your platform."
     exit 1
   fi

   DASHBOARD_DIR="$PLUGIN_ROOT/packages/dashboard"
   ```

4. **Fast path — try the prebuilt viewer first (no install, no build).** Each release ships a self-contained viewer tarball; run it pinned to the installed plugin version:
   ```bash
   : "${PLUGIN_ROOT:?Run step 3 first so PLUGIN_ROOT is set}"
   : "${PROJECT_DIR:?Run step 1 first so PROJECT_DIR is set}"
   PLUGIN_VERSION=$(node -p "require('$PLUGIN_ROOT/package.json').version")
   VIEWER_URL="https://github.com/Egonex-AI/Understand-Anything/releases/download/v${PLUGIN_VERSION}/understand-anything-viewer.tgz"
   npx --yes "$VIEWER_URL" "$PROJECT_DIR"
   ```
   Run this in the background. It prints the same `🔑  Dashboard URL` line as the dev server:
   - If the line appears, **skip steps 5-6** and continue at step 7.
   - If the process exits without printing it (no release asset for this version, or no network), fall back to steps 5-6.

5. Fallback: install dependencies and build if needed:
   ```bash
   : "${PLUGIN_ROOT:?Run step 3 first so PLUGIN_ROOT is set}"
   DASHBOARD_DIR="${DASHBOARD_DIR:-$PLUGIN_ROOT/packages/dashboard}"
   cd "$DASHBOARD_DIR" && (pnpm install --frozen-lockfile 2>/dev/null || pnpm install)
   ```
   Then ensure the core package is built (the dashboard depends on it):
   ```bash
   : "${PLUGIN_ROOT:?Run step 3 first so PLUGIN_ROOT is set}"
   cd "$PLUGIN_ROOT" && pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core build
   ```

6. Fallback: start the Vite dev server pointing at the project's knowledge graph.

   **Local session** (default — binds to localhost only):
   ```bash
   : "${PROJECT_DIR:?Run step 1 first so PROJECT_DIR is set}"
   : "${DASHBOARD_DIR:?Run step 5 first so DASHBOARD_DIR is set}"
   cd "$DASHBOARD_DIR" && GRAPH_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR" npx vite --host 127.0.0.1
   ```

   **Remote session.** A localhost-only bind cannot be reached from the user's browser when Vite runs
   on another machine, and Vite rejects domain-name `Host` headers with
   `Blocked request. This host ("…") is not allowed.` Detect it, and if remote **ask the user which
   hostname or IP they will browse from** before launching (if they decline, treat it as local):
   ```bash
   [ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ] || [ -n "$SSH_TTY" ] || [ -n "$SSH_CLIENT" ] && echo remote || echo local
   ```
   ```bash
   cd "$DASHBOARD_DIR" && GRAPH_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR" \
     UNDERSTAND_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
     UNDERSTAND_ALLOWED_HOSTS=<remote-host> \
     npx vite
   ```
   `UNDERSTAND_HOST=0.0.0.0` accepts connections from outside localhost, and `UNDERSTAND_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
   whitelists the `Host` header. The one-time access token still gates every data endpoint, so this
   widens reachability without widening authorization.

   Run this in the background so the user can continue working. The URL Vite prints always shows
   `127.0.0.1`; for a remote session substitute `<remote-host>` when reporting it.

7. **Capture the access token URL from the server output.** The server (viewer or Vite) prints a line like:
   ```
   🔑  Dashboard URL: http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>?token=<TOKEN>
   ```
   Extract the full URL including the `?token=` parameter. The token is required to access the knowledge graph data — without it the dashboard will show an "Access Token Required" gate.

8. Report to the user, including the full tokenized URL:
   ```
   Dashboard started at http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>?token=<TOKEN>
   Viewing: $UA_DIR/knowledge-graph.json

   The dashboard is running in the background. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop it.
   ```
   **Important:** Always include the `?token=` parameter in the URL you share. If you omit it, the user will be blocked by the token gate and have to manually find the token in the terminal output.

## Notes

- The fast path (step 4) downloads a version-pinned, self-contained viewer from the GitHub release — nothing is installed into the plugin directory and no build runs
- The dashboard auto-opens in the default browser (both the viewer and Vite's `--open`)
- If port 5173 is already in use, the next available port is picked (both paths)
- In the fallback, the `GRAPH_DIR` environment variable tells the dev server where to find the knowledge graph

### Serving from a remote VM

By default the dev server binds to `127.0.0.1` and Vite rejects requests whose `Host` header is a
domain name with `Blocked request. This host ("example.com") is not allowed.` (#485). To serve the
dashboard from a remote machine reached via a domain or public IP, set these before launching Vite:

```bash
GRAPH_DIR=<project-dir> \
UNDERSTAND_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
UNDERSTAND_ALLOWED_HOSTS=example.com,example1.com \
npx vite
```

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `UNDERSTAND_HOST` | Overrides the bind address (e.g. `0.0.0.0`). Unset = `127.0.0.1`. |
| `UNDERSTAND_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated allowlist for the `Host` header. `all` / `true` / `*` disables the check entirely. Unset = Vite's strict default. |

**The strict default is deliberate.** Both variables are opt-in, so an unconfigured install keeps
localhost-only behaviour and nothing about this change loosens the out-of-the-box posture. The
one-time access token continues to gate every data endpoint either way — these variables control
*reachability*, never *authorization*, and `UNDERSTAND_ALLOWED_HOSTS=all` on a publicly routable
interface still leaves the token as the only thing between the internet and your graph.
